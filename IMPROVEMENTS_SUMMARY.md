## Major Fixes

1. **PyMuPDF (fitz) Error Resolved**
   - Fixed incorrect usage of `fitz.fitz.FZ_ERROR_GENERIC` in app.py
   - Updated error handling for PDF operations

2. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Installed PyTorch for validator.py functionality 
   - Updated requirements.txt with specific version ranges
   - Added installation instructions for all dependencies

3. **Code Structure Cleanup**
   - Fixed syntax errors in Python files
   - Removed redundant files (reversion.py, utils.py)
   - Implemented better error handling throughout

## Performance Enhancements

1. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Implemented threading for long-running operations:
     - PDF anonymization

     - Synthetic test data generation
     - Batch testing capabilities
     - Anonymization quality metrics
     - Test report generation

2. **Usage Examples**
   ```bash
   # Run quick tests
   python run_tests.py --type quick
   
   # Run thorough testing
   python run_tests.py --type thorough
   ```

## Documentation

1. **User Documentation**
   - README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - INSTALLATION.md with detailed setup steps
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issue solutions

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - issues_and_improvements.md tracking project status
