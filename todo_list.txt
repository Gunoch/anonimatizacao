Completed Tasks:
-----------------
1. Bug Fixes and Code Structure:
   * Fixed syntax errors in multiple Python files (pdf_utils.py, anonymizer.py, detection.py, validator.py).
   * Installed necessary libraries: spacy, transformers, faker, and the Portuguese language model (pt_core_news_sm).
   * Ensured clean code structure with proper imports.
   * Fixed PyMuPDF (fitz) usage in app.py to resolve "module 'fitz' has no attribute 'fitz'" error.
   * Successfully installed PyTorch for validator.py functionality.

2. Performance and Error Handling:
   * Implemented asynchronous processing for long-running operations using threading
   * Improved error handling in pdf_utils.py with more detailed error messages
   * Enhanced PDF saving function with better error handling and page numbering
   * Updated requirements.txt with specific version ranges for all dependencies

Pending Improvements & Tasks:
----------------------------

0. Testing and Verification:
   * Test the application thoroughly with various PDF documents.
   * Verify that all features work as expected after dependency fixes.

1. Enhanced Detection Accuracy and Coverage:
    * Implement contextual disambiguation for more accurate sensitive data detection.
    * Allow users to define custom detection rules (e.g., via a configuration file or UI).
    * Develop more sophisticated address detection and anonymization logic.

2. Improved User Experience (UX) and Interactivity:
    * Interactive Preview & Confirmation: Allow users to review detected sensitive items on the PDF (or text) and selectively include/exclude them before anonymization.
    * More Comprehensive/Exportable Anonymization Log: Enhance the current log, possibly with options to export it.
    * Full Side-by-Side View: Implement a more robust visual comparison between original and anonymized content, potentially highlighting changes.

3. Robustness and Practicality for Real-World Use:
    * Handling of Scanned PDFs (OCR): Integrate an OCR library (e.g., Tesseract via pytesseract) to extract text from image-based PDFs.
    * Granular Error Handling: Continue refining error handling throughout the application (app.py and utility modules) to provide more specific and user-friendly error messages for various failure scenarios (e.g., corrupted PDFs, model loading issues, file permission errors).

4. More Reliable Validation:
    * Use a more powerful/appropriate Portuguese-specific or multilingual LLM for the validation step to improve accuracy in detecting remaining PII.
    * Refine validation prompting techniques or the analysis of the LLM's output for better results.

5. Performance for Large Documents:
    * Optimize memory usage and processing speed for very large PDFs
    * Add progress indicators with page numbers during text extraction and processing
    * Consider implementing batch processing for extremely large documents

6. Code & Project Cleanup:
    * Manually delete the following old/redundant Python files from the workspace:
        - reversion.py (functionality is now integrated in app.py)
        - utils.py (check if its functions were fully migrated to other modules)

7. Testing and Refinement:
    * Conduct thorough testing with a diverse range of PDF documents using the new test_utils.py:
      ```
      python test_utils.py --mode batch --count 10 --output test_results
      ```
    * Review test reports and improve detection algorithms based on findings.
    * Refine regex patterns and spaCy entity recognition based on testing results.
    * Test the application with larger documents to identify performance bottlenecks.

8. Documentation:
    * Create comprehensive documentation for users on how to use the application.
    * Document the code architecture and module interactions for future maintenance.
    * Add comments to complex code sections for better maintainability.
