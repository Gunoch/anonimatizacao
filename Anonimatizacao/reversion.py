'''Module for reverting anonymized text back to original (de-anonymization).

Note: True de-anonymization requires a stored mapping of original PII to the 
fake data used during anonymization. The current anonymization implementation 
does not store these mappings, so direct reversion is not possible without 
modifying the anonymization process to create and save such a map.
'''

# Placeholder for de-anonymization mapping (if it were stored)
# Example: DEANONYMIZATION_MAP = {"fake_email@example.com": "real_email@example.com", ...}

def deanonymize_text(anonymized_text: str, mapping: dict | None = None) -> str:
    """
    Attempts to revert anonymized text to its original form using a provided mapping.

    Args:
        anonymized_text: The text that has been anonymized.
        mapping: A dictionary where keys are anonymized values and values are 
                 the original PII. If None, or if a value is not in the map,
                 it cannot be reverted.

    Returns:
        The text with PII potentially reverted, or the original anonymized text
        if no mapping is provided or matches are found.
    """
    if not mapping:
        print("Warning: No de-anonymization mapping provided. Cannot revert text.")
        # Or raise an error, or return the text as is.
        return anonymized_text

    # This is a simplified example. A robust solution would need to handle
    # overlapping replacements, different PII types, etc.
    # The core idea is to iterate through the map and replace fake data with original data.
    
    # For a simple string replacement based on the map:
    # This won't work well if fake data could be substrings of other fake data or legitimate text.
    # A more robust approach would be to re-tokenize or use the same regex/NER used for anonymization
    # to identify the fake entities and then look them up in the map.
    
    # As a basic illustration (highly dependent on how anonymization was done):
    # Let's assume the mapping keys are the exact fake strings inserted.
    # This is often not feasible with Faker if the same PII type was replaced multiple times
    # with different fake values unless each specific replacement was logged.

    # If the anonymization process logged specific (original_value, fake_value) pairs,
    # then this function would use those pairs to revert.

    # Given the current anonymization.py, this function is largely conceptual
    # as the required mappings are not generated or stored.
